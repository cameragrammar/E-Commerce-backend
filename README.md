The goal of the project was to use the source code to build a MySQL database, using Sequelize.

Running "npm install" to install dependencies, seeding the database, and then running the server file will allow us to view product data in JSON format in Insomnia.

API GET routes can be opened in Insomnia for categories, products, and tags.

Tests can be run using POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia.
